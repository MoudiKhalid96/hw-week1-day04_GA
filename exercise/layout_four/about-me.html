                        <p>Imagine it's 13 weeks from now, and you've started taking on work as a freelance developer. So far you've done work for (imaginary) companies like Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and Citipix, and you want to showcase the web apps and landing pages you've built for them. Take what you've learned from class and the pre-work and build a portfolio site, using HTML and simple CSS, that showcases your hard work from the past 13 months.
                        <br>
                        Create two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value add as a contract developer, and your 'Portfolio' should include screenshots with descriptions of the work you've done for the companies mentioned above. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages--we've provided you with some sample copy that you can use.</p>
